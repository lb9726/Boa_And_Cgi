sudo apt-get install ocaml ocaml-findlib -y
报错了，尝试sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
https://blog.csdn.net/wangyezi19930928/article/details/54928201  update 和 upgrade区别
还是报failed尝试自己编译源码安装
https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/findlib/1.7.3-2
下载了findlib_1.7.3.orig.tar.gz 解压后根据INSTALL的方法试了一下
./configure
make all
make install 
再次执行make deconfig之后执行ok了

下一步执行编译 make V=s -j 16
